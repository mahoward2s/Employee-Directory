## What To Expect:
- The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

![Employee-Directory](/employeedirectory/public/usagegif.gif)

## Description:
- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
- An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

- This application allows an employee or manager to quickly search and identify employees by there name.  The information about the employee includes their department, email, and phone number.

- Going forward there are still some styling changes I would like to make and some functionality changes with the searching/filtering.
